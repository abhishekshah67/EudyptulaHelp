Two basic things before you start:
Little Penguine hates HTML mails. Convert your mails to plain text mode.
Best way to proceed would be to setup thunderbird mail client and change the encoding to Western and plain text. 
If you want to change encoding of files try the following command in VI(you got to use vi for this)
:write ++enc=ISO-8859-1  task1.c

Be patient, the submission takes time to produce results.
